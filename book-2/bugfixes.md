## Changelog:
- Fixed the tavern music bug at night in Book 2. If you're not OCD you probably didn't even notice it, but it was driving me crazy.
- Fixed multiple bugs in the Book 2 love route throne room scenes. Many choices gave the wrong points, had the wrong name, etc.

<br>

I did want to fix the broken ending and unplayable/hidden Katara scene in Book 1, but it'd take me so long to sift through all the spagetti code that I don't think it's even worth it.

If you know of any small bugs or easy possible QoL changes for *Book 1 or the Book 2 love route*, feel free to let me know. Just message @ me in [the thread.](https://f95zone.com/threads/four-elements-trainer-v0-6-13e-mity.730/)

## Installation:
Just unzip and put it in your game folder. The patch will work with any game version, even future game updates.
