## Changelog:
 - Fixed the default setting for the crab battles against Shady Guy. The default setting says that you've already beaten him, even if you've never fought him. So when you get to the crab battle section he'll automatically appear saying you've beaten him which causes a weird bug and prevents you from getting a reward.
 - Fixed the tavern music bug at night in Book 2. If you're not OCD you probably didn't even notice it, but it was driving me crazy.
- Fixed multiple bugs in the Book 2 love route throne room scenes. Many choices gave the wrong points, had the wrong name, etc.
- Removed the wrinkles on Mai's face in the images for the beach bj scene. WHY did she have old person wrinkles on her face in this scene? =(
- To do: Fix bug that prevents you from using rollback after getting the island store
- To do: Add an option to skip all the crab battles

I did want to fix the broken ending and unplayable/hidden Katara scene in Book 1, but it'd take me so long to sift through all the spagetti code that I don't think it's even worth it.

If you know of any small bugs or easy possible QoL changes for *Book 1 or the Book 2 love route*, feel free to let me know. Just message @ me in [the thread.](https://f95zone.com/threads/four-elements-trainer-v0-6-13e-mity.730/)
