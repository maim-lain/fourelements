# Game Mechanics
## Tavern:
#### Drink Recipes
Drink | 1 | 2
--- | ---: | ---:
Wanker | Red | Blue
Tickleberry | Green | Pink
Slapdapper | Yellow | Green
Slumpthumper | Pink | Blue
Hank | Grey | Red
Little tart | Blue | Yellow
Old juice | Grey | Blue
Coinpouch | Pink | Red

#### Serve drinks
- When serving drinks if you use the in-game recipe book you will earn significantly less money on your tip. So if you don't remember a recipe, just tab out and look at the chart here so you don't lose any money.
- You earn 45 coins per tip which means you get 135 coins per bartending shift. The exception to this is your first four shifts of serving drinks where you will only earn 24 coins per tip before being promoted.

#### Drink with soliders
- The soldiers are only meant to be talked to during certain quests.

#### Gamble vs Ty Lee
- Gambling on blackjack isn't an effective or time efficient way to make money, so there's not much reason to play it.

<br>
<br>

## Training:
Training increases your firebending level. The higher your level, the more damage you do in battles.

#### Training Requirements
Level | Requirement
:---: | ---
1 - 5 | None
6 | Battles = 6
7 | Tactics = 2
8 | Ember Island

<br>
<br>

## Palace:
#### Azulas room
- Her room is the location of many events and scenes, and is also a place you will frequently visit while doing quests.

#### Throne room
- The throne room is available during the day and is the location of the Azula throne room scenes.

<br>
<br>

## Tower:
#### Tactics
Level | Requirement | Answer
--- | --- | ---
1 | Battles = 10 | Blitz
2 | None | 1 or 2

<br>
<br>

## Leave City (combat):
When you win a battle you will receive 30-50 coins and have a 50% chance to have a fresh girl added to the farm.

#### Unit counters
Unit | Strong vs.
--- | ---
Infantry | Tank
Cavalry | Infantry
Tank | Cavalry

<br>
<br>

## Armory:
- At the armory you can buy armor for yourself, two troops to help you in battle, and health bonuses for both troops.
- When you buy one of the four armors you are automatically given the health bonus it provides, however you can only have one set of armor equipped at a time. This means it's a good idea to only buy the best armor since previous armors don't give retroactive bonuses, i.e. they are a waste of money. If you save your money during the first few days of the game it's possible to buy the Dragon armor on day 5.
- At night the armory is also the location of Mai's scenes.

<br>
<br>

## Farm Mechanics (simple version):
- Use ```Ctrl``` to speed up farm visits/milking  
#1 - Visit the farm every day at night  
#2 - Milk used girls  
#3 - Fuck girls who aren't pregnant  
#4 - Pregnant -> Milk -> Nipples -> Let her cum  
#5 - Leave farm

<br>
<br>

## Farm Mechanics:
- How do I get more girls?
  - Once you unlock the farm every time you win a battle you get +1 fresh girl. You can also buy used girls for $250 at the shop but it's a waste of money, so never buy them.
- How does pregnancy work?
  - 20 days must pass for a pregnant girl to give birth. After a pregnant girl gives birth she becomes a used girl.
- How do Azula visits work?
  - Azula will visit you every 7 days to pay you. If you have 0 pregnant girls when she visits (this should only happen if you don't use the farm at all) she will give you +1 pregnant girls.
- How much do I get paid?
  - 5 coins per milking, 10 coins per birth.
- Why shouldn't I just use the lever to milk the girls?
  - You can double the amount of money you make from the farm by using the method I describe in the simplified farm mechanics. If you just use the lever to milk the girls then: ```milk = used_girls + pregnant_girls``` but if you use the method I discovered then: ```milk = used_girls + used_girls_made_pregnant + (pregnant_girls * 2) + 1```
- What is morality?
  - Morality isn't used in the love route and has no effect on anything in the love route.
