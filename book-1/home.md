## Notes on Game Mechanics
Here are my notes on all the mechanics of the game, sorted by location. If you're like me then you probably had a lot of questions about the game like if the mystery night girl visits have any purpose, if there was anything special or hidden at the marketplace alley, what the drop rates of the stones from the mine were, and so on. Well all the answers to those questions and more are below.&nbsp; =)

<br>
<br>

## Day Locations
### Marketplace -> Shop
- If you need to go to the shop to buy something, use the shop at night. Going to the shop during the day will cause the game to skip the time to night once you exit the shop. However exiting the shop at night does not cause the game to skip the time to day.
- Once you complete the sidequest *Expanding the shop* you will automatically earn 20-40 coins at the start of they day. It's a good idea to start working on this quest as soon as the game starts so you can start getting free money as soon as possible, meaning you won't have to grind for money.
- Donating 50 coins to the shop has no purpose.

<br>

### Marketplace -> Elder Council
- Endorsing Katara gives +1 Respect
- Visiting Katara's house for the first time during the day unlocks the option to visit the elder council

<br>

### Training
- Training gives +2 Waterbending
- Your waterbending level has no effect on the difficulty of hunting. Ergo having high waterbending does not make hunting easier (sadly).

<br>

### Hunting
- Hunting gives +1 Affection. If Katara is angry it will also lower her anger level by 1.
- Pressing `Tab` enables skip mode which is extremely helpful for speeding up hunting.
- You will need 2 potions per hunting trip, but if the RNG gods are very displeased, you might need 3.
- How to hunt 101:
  1. If you are under 20% HP -> Healing potion
  2. If the mooselion moved its head last turn and didn't attack -> Defend
  3. If you don't need to heal or defend -> Attack

<br>

### Mountain
- You only need to visit the mountain when the story tells you. It doesn't have any other purpose.

<br>

### School
- The school is just a place you go for some quests and scenes.

<br>

### Mine
- You can go to the mine to mine stones for money and do a couple of sidequests.
- If you want to abuse the rollback feature of Ren'Py to change stone rarity, the point where the RNG for stone rarity is activated is after you say 'Yes' to 'Should I mine?'
- On average you get 50 coins per trip to the mine. *For anyone curious, at first I wrote some quick Python code to simulate 1,000 visits to the mine and saw it was around 50 coins on average. Then I realized there was probably a simple equation I could have used instead, [and there was.](http://www.statisticshowto.com/find-the-mean-of-the-probability-distribution-binomial/) The result of which is 50.45 coins.&nbsp; =P*
- Here are the drop rates and value for all the stones:
  - Common brown stone - 43% chance - 25 coins
  - Shiny blue stone - 36% chance - 50 coins
  - Rare red stone - 14% chance - 80 coins
  - Super rare white stone - 7% chance - 150 coins

## Night Locations
### Home
- Checking mail will skip to the next day and give you 20-40 coins. There are 11 different letters you can get, but you don't gain anything by having seen them all. After you read the 11th letter you will get the same letter everytime.
- Sleeping will skip to the next day but has no other purpose. You should check your mail instead because that will give you coins.
- Everytime you check your mail or choose sleep, there is a 20% chance of getting the mystery girl blowjob scene. After you've seen the scene once the next time she appears you have the option of telling her to go away forever. The mystery girl has no purpose other than being a scene to watch. There is no secret related to her and nothing special happens if you tell her to go away forever or to keep coming back (aside from her leaving forever or coming back).

<br>

### Marketplace -> Visit alley
- Visiting the alley gives you a 40% chance of seeing the Lesbians with strap-on scene. The alley has no other purpose or any secrets.
