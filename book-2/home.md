# Game Mechanics
## Tavern:
#### Drink Recipes
Drink | 1 | 2
--- | ---: | ---:
Wanker | Red | Blue
Tickleberry | Green | Pink
Slapdapper | Yellow | Green
Slumpthumper | Pink | Blue
Hank | Grey | Red
Little tart | Blue | Yellow
Old juice | Grey | Blue
Coinpouch | Pink | Red

<br>

#### Serve drinks
- When serving drinks if you use the in-game recipe book you will earn significantly less money on your tip. So if you don't remember a recipe, just tab out and look at the chart here so you don't lose any money.
- You earn 45 coins per tip which means you get 135 coins per bartending shift. The exception to this is your first four shifts of serving drinks where you will only earn 24 coins per tip before being promoted.

#### Drink with soliders
- They are only meant to be talked to during certain quests.

#### Gamble vs Ty Lee
- Gambling on blackjack isn't an effective or time efficient way to make money. So unless you're a filthy casual who enjoys playing blackjack instead of [Pazaak](https://i.redd.it/xlvvruihjg9y.png), don't bother with it.

## Training:
- Training increases your firebending level. The higher your level, the more damage you do in battles.

## Armory:
- At the armory you can buy armor for yourself, two troops to help you in battle, and health bonuses for both troops.
- When you buy one of the four armors you are automatically given the health bonus it provides, however you can only have one set of armor equipped at a time. This means it's a good idea to only buy the best armor since previous armors don't give retroactive bonuses, i.e. they are a waste of money. If you save your money during the first few days of the game it's possible to buy the Dragon armor on day 5.
- At night the armory is also the location of Mai's scenes.

<br>

## Farm Mechanics (simple version):
- Use ```Ctrl``` to speed up farm visits/milking  
#1 - Visit the farm every day at night  
#2 - Milk used girls  
#3 - Fuck girls who aren't pregnant  
#4 - Pregnant -> Milk -> Nipples -> Let her cum  
#5 - Leave farm

<br>
<br>

## Farm Mechanics:
- How do I get more girls?
  - Once you unlock the farm every time you win a battle you get +1 fresh girl. You can also buy used girls for $250 at the shop but it's a waste of money, so never buy them.
- How does pregnancy work?
  - Visiting the farm for the first time on a day will give +1 farm visits. Pregnant girls need '20 farm visits' to give birth. The game says it's '20 days' but actually pregnant girls will only progress in their pregnancy if you visit the farm. To give an example, if a girl is 1/20 days pregnant and you don't visit the farm for 100 days she will still be 1/20 days pregnant even after 100 days have passed. Visiting the farm multiple times on the same day will still only give +1 farm visits. After a pregnant girl gives birth she becomes a used girl.
- How do Azula visits work?
  - Azula will visit you every 7 days to pay you. If you have 0 pregnant girls when she visits (this should never happen unless you totally neglect using the farm) she will give you +1 pregnant girls.
- How much do I get paid?
  - 5 coins per milking, 10 coins per birth.
- Why shouldn't I just use the lever to milk the girls?
  - You can double the amount of money you make from the farm by using the method I describe in the simplified farm mechanics. If you just use the lever to milk the girls then: ```milk = used_girls + pregnant_girls``` but if you use the method I discovered then: ```milk = used_girls + used_girls_made_pregnant + (pregnant_girls * 2) + 1```
- What is morality?
  - Morality isn't used in the love route and has no effect on anything in the love route.
